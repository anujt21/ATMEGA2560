# ATMEGA 2560 projects

This is my repository containing all my ATMEGA 2560 projects. Below is a brief descirption of each project.

## Projects:

### Lab 1:
This is my 1st lab project in the class of ECE 372. The code performs a very simple pattern for 8 LEDs. First, the outermost LEDs are turned on, then the subsequent inner LED pairs are turned on. Once, it reaches the 4th and 5th LED, the pattern is reversed.

### Lab 2:
In this project, 4 LEDs display the bit pattern for 0 to 15 on repeat. The delay time between the numbers toggles between 100 and 200 ms when the button is pressed and released.
